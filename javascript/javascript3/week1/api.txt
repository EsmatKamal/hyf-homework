"The birds circled endlessly in the sky, their wings slicing through the clouds like knives. 
Down on the ground, the people watched in awe as the sky bled scarlet rain."

"In the desert, the cacti grew tall and thin like spires. 
At night, they would hum to each other in a language only they understood."

"The girl had a map of the world tattooed on her back, and as she traveled, 
new lands and seas would appear on her skin like magic."

"The clock on the wall ticked backwards, each chime echoing through time like a 
pebble thrown into a still pool."

"The river was made of silver and flowed through the city like a serpent. 
Those who drank from it would gain the power to see the future, but at the cost of their own memories."
